# Photochem

`Photochem` is a photochemical and climate model of planet's atmospheres. Given inputs, like the stellar UV flux, the atmospheric temperature structure, etc., this code will find the steady-state chemical composition of an atmosphere, or evolve atmospheres through time. The code also contains a 1-D climate model and a chemical equilibrium solver.

To use `Photochem`, first install it following the [installation instructions](installation.md), then try out either the [Photochemistry] or [Climate] introductory tutorials.
